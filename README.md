# Car-lane-detector

A car lane detection system based on image processing.

---

## Project Overview
This project implements a lane detection algorithm to identify and mark lanes on roads using images. The primary goal is to aid autonomous driving systems by providing a visual representation of road lanes.

---

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Detects lane lines in road images.
- **Edge Detection**: Uses algorithms like Canny edge detection for identifying lane edges.
- **Lane Overlay**: Marks detected lanes on the input image for better visualization.

---

## Example
Below is an example of the lane detection system:
